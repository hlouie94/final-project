                <p>Angel Bites was founded by Lara Durell and Stacy Dun in 2010 and have been providing sweet and tasty treats to its customers ever since. Angel Bites' vision is to provide a variety of bit-sized sweets to customers whenever they desire it. The goal is to satisfy the customers sweet tooth without sacrificing quality. Angel Bites allows the customer to choose a flavor preference while allowing a bit of mystery. Angel Bite workers get to curate their box of sweets themselves while keeping the customer's flavor preference in mind. We as a company take the quality of treats very seriously. We make sure to provide only the freshest of treats.     </p>
